<h1>Most of apps connected to server, but server is down for now. Multiple REST server is in develop.</h1>
<h3>Student diary</h3>
<p>This app, useful for universities. In this version app shows, news of University which is broadcasted from the server, also shows schedule of group, burrows which need to pass and teachers of group with their contact information. App includes authorization, so schedule burrows and teachers are linked to the user which authorized in this app.</p>
<p>Registration or sign up function is depricated in this app, cuz this app is only part of the web-site of university </p>
